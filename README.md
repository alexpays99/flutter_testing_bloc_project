# Bloc learning path
In this repository will be my road of learning Bloc state management.
Finaly I will make project using BloC, with authentication and registration forms. You can create an account and upload photos into tirebase storage. Authenticaton and registration process is using firebase auth services.
Also it's possible to delete an account. All of photos in storage will be removed automatically.
